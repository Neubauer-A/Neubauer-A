### Hello!

I'm Alex Neubauer, a data engineer who began falling in love with data as an amateur Go player. As the skill of the game's AI grew to superhuman levels, I felt the need to discover how exactly that was possible and to see if I could make something similar. That led me down the rabbit hole of machine learning and data analytics where I've enjoyed applying the new things that I learn each day, especially to other subjects I'm fascinated by: art, philosophy, healthcare, and economics. 

Aside from my professional projects, I'm currently working on building out data warehousing and analysis capacities for a piece of software, soon to be open-source, that will aid companies and "bug hunters" in more efficiently detecting security flaws in their web apps.
