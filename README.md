### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m currently working on an automated [trading program](https://github.com/Neubauer-A/CoinBot) for the Kraken exchange.
- Iâ€™m currently learning more about [curiosity algorithms](https://news.mit.edu/2020/automating-search-entirely-new-curiosity-algorithms-0428).
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that puts software development in contact with philosophy, art, finance, or strategy games.
- Talk to me about Twin Peaks theories or how to solve niche problems in TensorFlow.
